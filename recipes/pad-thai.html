    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>I love pad thai. Though I've made a few different recipes, but haven't landed on 
    one that really nailed yet. This one looks good so I'll give it a shot. Thai cooking
    seeks to balance the flavors of sweet, salty, sour, bitter, and heat. So whatever 
    you do, aim for that.
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>8 ounces flat rice noodles</li>
        <li>3 tbsp oil</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>8 ounces uncooked shrimp, chicken, or extra firm tofu, cut into small pieces</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup fresh bean sprouts</li>
        <li>1 red bell pepper, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>3 green onions, chopped</li>
        <li>1/2 cup dry roasted peanuts</li>
        <li>2 limes</li>
        <li>1/2 cup fresh cilantro, chopped</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Cook noodles according to package instructions, just until tender.  Rinse under cold water.</li>
        <li>Mix the sauce ingredients together. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat 1Â½ tablespoons of oil in a large saucepan or wok over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Add the shrimp, chicken or tofu, garlic and bell pepper. The shrimp will cook quickly, about 1-2 minutes on each side, or until pink. If using chicken, cook until just cooked through, about 3-4 minutes, flipping only once.</li>
        <li>Push everything to the side of the pan. Add a little more oil and add the beaten eggs. Scramble the eggs, breaking them into small pieces with a spatula as they cook.</li>
        <li>Add noodles, sauce, bean sprouts and peanuts to the pan (reserving some peanuts for topping at the end). Toss everything to combine.</li>
        <li>Top with green onions, extra peanuts, cilantro and lime wedges. Serve immediately!</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Notes</h3>

    <p>To use tamarind paste in the sauce, substitute 2 Tablespoons in place of the vinegar.</p>
